# Conceptual Accessory Gearbox Design

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains the design and analysis of a **Conceptual Accessory Gearbox** for a commercial aircraft. The gearbox is mounted beneath the jet engine compressor case and is driven by the engine compressor shaft to power essential components such as the fuel pump, oil pump, hydraulic pump, and electrical generator. This project is developed as part of the ME-314 Group Design Project under the supervision of Professor Ricardo Ayala.

## Features
- **Drive System:** 
  - Bevel gear design for torque transfer from the compressor shaft to the accessory drive shaft.
  - 19 gears distributed across 11 shafts to deliver power efficiently.

- **Gear Design:** 
  - Spur and helical gears with a 20° pressure angle.
  - Designed to AGMA standards with factors of safety:
    - **1.3 for bending** stresses.
    - **1.15 for contact** stresses.

- **Material Selection:** 
  - Gears: Annealed 31CrMoV9 steel.
  - Shafts: AISI 4140 Quenched and Tempered steel.

- **Analysis Tools:**
  - Stress analysis for gears (bending and contact) and shafts.
  - Fatigue life evaluation (S-N curves) for critical components.
  - SolidWorks for schematic layouts and visualizations.

## Design Requirements
1. **Performance:**
   - Drive accessory components at specified speeds and torques:
     - Oil pump: 8500 rev/min, 259.5 in·lbf.
     - Fuel pump: 13950 rev/min, 135.5 in·lbf.
     - Hydraulic pump: 3500 rev/min, 270.1 in·lbf.
     - Electrical generator: 6795 rev/min, 185.5 in·lbf.

2. **Safety Factors:**
   - Gears: 1.3 (bending), 1.15 (contact).
   - Shafts: 1.15 (accessory drive), 1.1 (component shafts).

3. **Physical Constraints:**
   - Total weight (gearbox + components): ≤260 lbf.
   - Operating temperature: ≤250°F.

## Design Deliverables
- **Gear Train Layout:** A detailed configuration using compound and individual gears to optimize space and function within the gearbox housing.
- **Stress and Fatigue Analysis:** Validation against AGMA standards and safety requirements.
- **Shaft Sizing and Support:** Shaft diameters and lengths tailored for optimal performance and durability.
- **Final Assembly Schematic:** CAD designs showcasing the gear train and housing dimensions.
